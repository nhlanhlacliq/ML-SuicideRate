## Polynomial Regression: Suicide Rate in South Africa (1996-2015)

-I obtained a dataset on suicide rates from kaggle.com and decided to practice
on cleaning data by working with only SA data and combining the number of suicides
from each section of the year into a year total.

-I then used sklearn's linear regression model to create a polynomial regression model
that would then be trained using the data and the plotted in the graph to show the
polynomial relationship.
